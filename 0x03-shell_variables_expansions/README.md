This project further explores the bash. We take a closer look at working with variables and expansions. We use variables that come preinstalled with shell and create some of our own. We also make use of
aliases. Aliases are useful for numerous reasons, one of which is to save yourself from typing cumbersome or obscure command sequence. An alias can be set as follows 

	 $alias rm="rm -i"

Now "rm" is an alias that will prompt the user before they delete anything. To unset an alias we use "unalias." More to follow.
